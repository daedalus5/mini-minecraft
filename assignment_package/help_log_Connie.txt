Shadow map help (part one)
Answer: Asked Zichuan
I was using the perspective projection matrix for my camera. Zichuan suggested I use an orthographic projection matrix to simulate direct light.

Shadow map help (part two)
Answer: Asked Vasu
After going over each step to debug my shadow map, Vasu and I realized my depth texture resolution and viewport do not match. Once, I changed the viewport to match the texture, it worked.

Why does OpenGL crash when I bind my frame buffer?
Answer: Asked Adam on Piazza
Two possible reasons. 1) I was doing the frame buffer binding in another class other than MyGL. I moved the code back into MyGL. 2) I ended up calling createRenderBuffers before binding the vao array.



Milestone 2

How do you repeat just a single tile in the texture?
Answer: Asked in class
You hard-code when the loop the texture in the fragment shader. Since all the tiles are 1/16 in width and height of the image dimensions, we can use % 1/16.

Why is the transparency weird? You can see the sky at some angles.
Answer: Asked Vasu
Since we are drawing Chunks one at a time, a transparent block may be drawn before its background is drawn. So the fragment shader does not know to use the background terrain for color.

How do I create a hash function for glm::ivec2?
Answer: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9047612/glmivec2-as-key-in-unordered-map
Someone on Stack Overflow posted a Struct with a hash function and comparison function for ivec2, that would be passed into the map.

How do I store two 32 bit ints into a 64 bit int?
Answer: Ishan
Ishan told me how to shift bits to the right and left and use XOR to combine two ints.

How do I split a 64 bit int into two 32 bit ints?
Answer: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2810280/how-to-store-a-64-bit-integer-in-two-32-bit-integers-and-convert-back-again
Shift bits for one int. The other could simply be casted to int.

How do I read from an interleaved VBO?
Answer: https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/Generic_Vertex_Attribute_-_examples
glVertexAttribPointer has two parameters. One for how much data each vertex is. The other is the offset of the particular data you want from the start of vertex data.
