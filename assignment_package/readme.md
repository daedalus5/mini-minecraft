Sagar- Camera Controls, Player Physics, Collisions.

For collision detection, I tried to predict the next position of each vertex of the bounding box of the player, and then preemptively stop the motion of the player if a potential collision was detected. The main challenges I faced with this assignment were the implementation of the collision detection and keeping track of the flow of information across the files.
